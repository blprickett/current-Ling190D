        "The exam should be opened on Moodle at 8 am ET on Friday May 6 and closed at 10 pm ET on the same date. The time limit is 2 hours for the exam. Your solution must be turned in as an **ipynb** file on **Moodle** before it is closed. Late exams will only be accepted at the instructors discretion. If you miss the submission window you will need to email me the exam and explain what is the reason right after the exam. Answer each question using only one cell (you can have multiple lines of code in one cell). You may create a copy of this notebook and open additional cells for testing, but when you turn in the exam, please only have one cell per question. Partial credit will be given. It is easier to give partial credit if you comment your code to say what each line is doing, or trying to do. If you can't solve a problem fully, try solving part of it for partial credit.\n",

Don't post or talk about the questions or your solution of the exam during the exam open window. Please DO NOT post questions of clarification to Piazza. Since not all students are taking the exam at the same time, this might create an unfair advantage.**"
