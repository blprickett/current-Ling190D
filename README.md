This repository contains sudent-facing assignment materials and code for COMPSCI 108 at UMass Amherst.

The content is organized in modules. Each module folder contains:

  2. Reading chapters listed in a text file
  3. Code used in class demos
  4. Homework for that module
  5. Labs for that module

To check which module is taught when, refer to the course text.

There are additional course materials in the following folders as follows:
- `projects`: Starter code for projects that have been assigned in previous years
- `reviews`: Midterm exam review

# Updating Course Materials
If you choose to update materials while you are teaching the course, please make your changes to this repository. If you would like to keep your changes separated from the original version, you can make them on [a new branch in this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) or by [forking this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). This will allow your changes to be merged back into this repository later by [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from the branch/fork with your updates to this repository.

At the end of the semester, if you have made updates to this repository that are merged into the master branch, we ask that you [create a release tag](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) on your last commit for that semester named with the semester and the year, for example ``Fall2022". Git tags are a useful way to bookmark key changes in the code at particular points in time. Creating a tagged release in Github makes it easy for future instructors to see what updates to materials were made as the course evolved. They can also serve as a snapshot of the code that can be easily retrieved to be re-used in the future.

# Exams and Solutions
Exams and solutions to assignments to be used with the auto-graders are stored in a paired private repository, [current-CS108-solutions repository](https://github.com/umass-data-science/current-CS108-solutions). These repositories should be kept in sync. If you make updates to an assignment or create a release tag in this repository, please update the solutions repository accordingly and vice versa.
